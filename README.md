# README For Angel Trinh's Portfolio

I have a passion for understanding consumers, learning new things, and solving problems. After working in advertising for a few years as a media planner, I decided to switch careers and to go into web development. As a former media planner, I was in charge of selecting the best outlet to drive the highest return on investment in print, online, and television media. For example, in online media I analyzed different players in the media landscape and chose the best partner for each respective campaign. Rather than selecting different types of media, as a fullstack web developer I would like to learn and apply skills to make a technology platform more efficient and effective for consumers.

I'm very passionate about learning how to write and apply code to solve problems. My first team coding project was "7 Recipes," which solves meal planning and time management issues. For this project I worked on a 4 member team (our group was called the Backstreet Boys) on a web app that randomizes recipes for each day of the week. Consumers have the option to randomize and delete recipes based on their dietary needs. Furthermore, he web app aggregates all of the ingredients (by respective item and quantity) for the entire week and sends the shopping list to Todoist (a to do list and task web/mobile app) making meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking easy.
